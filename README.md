# Résumé template
This is a Bootstrap résumé template pre-designed and pre-formatted. The only thing you must supply is content.

Every couple years I update my résumé. The trouble I always run into is that I end up rewriting my résumé because the software I used to build my résumé years ago is always too old. I finally gave up and made my résumé a web page.

# Usage
This is a preformatted résumé, which means you have zero freedom on changing the format. To edit the conent, you must edit the Yaml files below, all are found in the directory `_data`:
- `about.yml`
- `contacts.yml`
- `interests.yml`
- `projects.yml`
- `skills.yml`
- `timeline.yml`

# Résumé format
I did away with the usual sections "experience" and "education" and combined the 2 into a timeline. These days, folks are used to seeing infromation displayed in a timeline (Facebook and Twitter). In the [example][demo], education is listed at the bottom and the most recent job experience is at the top.
